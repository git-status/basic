This is a Chrome Extension that 
finds all your craigslist bookmarks and displays them in a 
table , does a screen scrape from CL to check status, 
and enables you to remove the bookmarks individually, by statuses.
In the initial versions versions I had a lot of trouble using localStorage so I swithced to
WebSQL.
It uses webSQL , Jquery, Bootstrap..underscore is included..b/c I think I will need it, 
when I refactor the app..

Still very much a work in progress. 
Just something that I am working on to learn JS app development..
